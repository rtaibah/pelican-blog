summary: Now I am no MS fan, but I understand their strategy of simplifying how things are done on their OS'es. But isn't this just idiotic? When going to Add or Remove Programs in the control panel, you will find small links on the right of the listed programs describing the frequency of use of each program. Now, occasionally, frequently, and rarely could be a bit vague. A more quantifiable amount of usage would make more sense.

When going to Add or Remove Programs in the control panel, you will find small links on the right of the listed programs describing the frequency of use of each program. Now, occasionally, frequently, and rarely could be a bit vague. A more quantifiable amount of usage would make more sense. But this is how MS describes it:

    Rarely ----> Rarely used
    Occasionally ---> Sometimes used
    Frequently ---> Used often

No shit, Redmond?
