Seems like there is nothing you can't buy off the Internet these days. Apparently the good fellas at Amazon are selling [Uranium ore](http://www.amazon.com/Uranium-Ore/dp/B000796XXM)! Yes you heard it U-R-A-N-I-U-M! You know the stuff that would bust your balls.

Maybe Bush should bomb Amazon. 

Anyways I did some research about this, since "Uranium Ore" is not exactly "Pure Uranium". Plus I doubt that Amazon would market such a thing (not that the authorities would let them anyways).

Uranium ore or Uraninite is a mineral that is mainly composited of UO2 or Uranium Dioxide. Pretty much like CO2 but with a Uranium atom instead of a Carbon atom. But it also contains smaller traces of UO3 and Oxides of Lead and Thorium and some other rare minerals. Uraninite helped [Marie Curie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria\_Sklodowska-Curie) discover Radium.

Uraninite is very radioactive, which still doesn't answer my question about how could Amazon  advertise such a thing? The [US Postal Service](http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub52/pub52c3_024.htm) has Urininite under the "Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable" category. Which means that it's legal to ship it, but thats probably just for research purposes and what not.

*Update: [Peter Rost](http://peterrost.blogspot.com/2007/11/amazoncom-sells-uranium.html) noticed a very disturbing thing. Apparently people who bought Uranium ore from Amazon, have very weird fetishes that only Uranium can complement!*
