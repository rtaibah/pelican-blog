![Open Hulu Blocked]({filename}/images/open-hulu-blocked.jpg)

With the beta launch of the free TV streaming service [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com "Hulu"), lots of people are scrambling to get their hands on an invite. I for one have submitted to Hulu for an invite since October, and I got nothing. [Mohammed Saleem](http://www.muhammadsaleem.com/ "Mohammed Saleem") did an [interview](http://www.last100.com/2007/12/10/openhulu-setting-hulus-videos-free/ "interview") with [Matt](http://www.minds1anda.com/ "Matt") who found a way to get around the "closed beta" nature of the service without breaking any rules in [OpenHulu.](http://www.openhulu.com "OpenHulu.")

[Matt](http://www.minds1anda.com/ "Matt") basically took advantage of the embed function of [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com "Hulu"), which enables you insert one or two videos on your blog (kinda like [youtube](http://www.youtube.com "youtube") on blogs). He took it to the next level and embedded all the videos on [OpenHulu](http://www.openhulu.com "OpenHulu"). However since the nature of [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com "Hulu") itself doesn't allow users outside the US to use the service, [OpenHulu](http://www.openhulu.com "OpenHulu") also falls short. Viewers outside America get the following message:

> Unfortunately this video is not currently available in your country or region. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Now don't get me wrong, I love what [Matt](http://www.minds1anda.com/ "Matt") did, but to call the service "open" when in reality its only open for 5% of the world's population is misleading. The whole interview and the name of service got me excited, only to be shocked with harsh reality 5 minutes later.
