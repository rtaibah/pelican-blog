> "One of [Mike Oldfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Oldfield "Mike Oldfield")'s best pieces of work, [Amarok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarok_%28software%29 "Amarok"), inspired the name behind the audio-player you are currently using. Thanks for choosing **Amarok**!

Oddly enough, Answer.com states that their source is [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.com "Wikipedia"), but this easter egg does not appear in the [Amarok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarok_%28software%29 "Amarok") article of wiki.
