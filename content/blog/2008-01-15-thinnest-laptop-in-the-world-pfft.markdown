summary: Well Steve Jobs just finished his keynote speech announcing the much rumored Macbook Air. Which measures 0.16-inches at its thinnest point, while its maximum height of 0.76-inches! Impressive huh?? Apple are touting the MBA as the thinnest laptop in the world. Or is it?

Actually Sony produced the [Vaio PCG-X505](http://www.mobiletechreview.com/notebooks/sony_vaio_X505.htm "Vaio PCG-X505") back in 2004\. This laptop boasted a .38″ to .8″ thickness! Pretty much comparable to the 2008 Apple wonder eh? And that was 4 years back!

The Toshiba [Portege r200](http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/toshiba-portege-r200/4505-3121_7-31341787.html "Portege r200") measures 11.3 inches wide, 9 inches deep, and 0.8 inch thick:

The [Asus U3S-A1B](http://www.excaliberpc.com/Asus_U3S-A1B_Piano_Black_Integrated/90NQFA913ED63EQL850T/partinfo-id-582059.html "Asus U3S-A1B") is also worthy of a mention, it is around 1.26 inches thick also:

And for the grand finale, Sharp had an [ultranotebook (PC-UM20)](http://www.smallbusinesscomputing.com/biztools/article.php/989541) back in 2002 boasting an impressive .65 inch thickness! That's .13 inches less than Macbook Air! At what cost? only $1700 only! (Thanks [AdRy](http://www.digg.com/users/AdRy) from digg)

Hmmm, so whats all the fuss about? So we have a 6 year old laptop that's already thinner, and around two thirds of the price. Sony had an almost identically slim model 4 years ago, Toshiba already offers a .8 inch model, and Asus has a model thats a 1/3 of an inch thicker. I am sure there are some others out there. Apple haven't brought anything new to the world, perhaps just sensational marketing.

Macbook Air will probably fly off the shelves, which I have no beef with, however I have beef with people thinking it's the best thing since sliced bread! Trust me people, nothing to see here, move along.
