[Problogger](http://www.problogger.net) is currently running a poll asking "What is your favorite social bookmarking site." I took a quick glance at the list and thought, yeah [Digg](http://www.digg.com) is gonna win this. I clicked on [Mixx](http://www.mixx.com) and submitted my vote. But to my amazement I found that [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com) is ahead of [Digg](http://www.digg.com) by a whopping 150 votes! What's interesting is that [Problogger](http://www.problogger.net/)'s main audience are bloggers who probably use social bookmarking for promoting their blogs. So what makes them prefer [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com) over [Digg](http://www.digg.com)? I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I have my thoughts on that and I will keep them for myself until [Problogger](http://www.problogger.net)'s poll is finished. So keep in tune!!
