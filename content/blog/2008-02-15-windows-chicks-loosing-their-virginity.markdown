During my \[interview with LinEx developer Daniel Campos\]\[1\], Daniel shared with me this picture. I found it hillarious, and decided to give it a post on it's own. It's basically a picture of two Windows Live chicks losing their virginity at a Linux conference held Spain ![:D](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif) . A captioning contest for this would totally kick ass!! \[Click here \]\[2\]for more details.
