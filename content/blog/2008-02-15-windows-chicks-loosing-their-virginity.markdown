During my [interview with LinEx developer Daniel Campos]({filename}/blog/2008-02-07-an-interview-with-an-extremadura-developer-bringing-linux-to-the-masses.markdown), Daniel shared with me this picture. I found it hillarious, and decided to give it a post on it's own. It's basically a picture of two Windows Live chicks losing their virginity at a Linux conference held Spain !:D

A captioning contest for this would totally kick ass!! [Click here]({filename}/blog/2008-02-15-caption-this-and-win-2.markdown) for more details.
