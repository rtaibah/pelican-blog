\> OiNK's final squeal was \[last October\]\[1\], AllOfMP3.com simply \[changed its name\]\[2\], and The Pirate Bay is \[busy reading a few legal documents\]\[3\]. All across the globe the war against file sharing is heating up, and amidst all this commotion, a new Russian company named \[Tagoo\]\[4\] apparently felt it was the right time to make a splash with its new MP3 search engine. The international game of whack-a-mole continues on, unsurprisingly, despite the IFPI's best efforts.
You just gotta love the Russians! Complete disregard of the IFPI and their antics! Tagoo is just great, it's a shame that I have discovered about this just now, it has been around for sometime. With Tagoo you can go straight to downloading without any hassles. It could also just serve as a music player, just search for the song you want and click on the embedded flash play button. Neat feature!Let's hope they can whether the storm!\[\[via Ars Technica\]\[5\]\]
