OiNK's final squeal was [last October](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071023-police-ifpi-make-bacon-of-oink-bittorrent-tracker.html), AllOfMP3.com simply [changed its name](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070703-allofmp3-com-breathes-its-final-breath.html), and The Pirate Bay is [busy reading a few legal documents](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080114-swedish-prosecutors-dump-4000-legal-docs-on-the-pirate-bay.html). All across the globe the war against file sharing is heating up, and amidst all this commotion, a new Russian company named [Tagoo](http://www.tagoo.ru) apparently felt it was the right time to make a splash with its new MP3 search engine. The international game of whack-a-mole continues on, unsurprisingly, despite the IFPI's best efforts.

You just gotta love the Russians! Complete disregard of the IFPI and their antics! Tagoo is just great, it's a shame that I have discovered about this just now, it has been around for sometime. With Tagoo you can go straight to downloading without any hassles. It could also just serve as a music player, just search for the song you want and click on the embedded flash play button. Neat feature! Let's hope they can whether the storm!
