Thanks to Apple, fitting gadgets into all kinds of envelopes has become some kind of a fad. Only on the Internet where one can shift focus from high-end expensive gadgets to a flat paper container!!
In case you have been living under a rock in the past couple of month, here is the video I am talking about:
And the followers:
\#\# Nintendo DS
Not as elegant as the original ad, but hey Nintendo is a cool brand also!!
\#\# Sony Vaio
Sleek, trendy, has ethernet, DVD drive, and multiple USB ports. And of course the most important: Fits in an envelope!
\#\# Eee PC
This would probably fit in an envelope smaller than a Manila one.
\#\# iPod Nano
Well I guess this is an obvious one ![:D](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif) . It could also fit in your pocket! Surprise Surprise!!
\#\# Nintendo Wii
Next gen's thinnest console! Ya baby!!
\#\# CRT Monitor
Some even tried fitting seemingly impossible items into envelopes. Over here Sam tries to fit a CRT monitor. Was he successful? Not sure about that.
\#\# Macbook Rock
Last and definitely least; costs less than $3000 and you can peg it at people!
