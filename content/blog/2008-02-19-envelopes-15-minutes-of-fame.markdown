Thanks to Apple, fitting gadgets into all kinds of envelopes has become some kind of a fad. Only on the Internet where one can shift focus from high-end expensive gadgets to a flat paper container!!

## Sony Vaio

Sleek, trendy, has ethernet, DVD drive, and multiple USB ports. And of course the most important: Fits in an envelope!

This would probably fit in an envelope smaller than a Manila one.

## CRT Monitor

Some even tried fitting seemingly impossible items into envelopes. Over here Sam tries to fit a CRT monitor. Was he successful? Not sure about that.

Last and definitely least; costs less than $3000 and you can peg it at people!
