So you thought Vista's desktop looked slick? Or the latest Leopard desktop is coolest thing after sliced bread? Well you probably haven't been properly exposed to Linux's customizability. Linux is so flexiblity is one of it's strongest selling points. With Linux you can easily even mimic [Vista](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO8MTAfFhGg "Vista") or [Leopard](http://lifehacker.com/software/how-to/make-your-linux-desktop-look-like-a-mac-317110.php "Leopard") totally free! Now I will take you through some of the kewlest, freshest, phatest desktops I have come across.
\*All Mac OSX taskbars in the following desktops can be created with different apps. [kooldock](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=50910 "kooldock"), [Avant Window Navigator](https://launchpad.net/awn "Avant Window Navigator"), or [Engage](http://pimpyourlinux.com/linux-feature-review/enlightenment-engage-dock/ "Engage") to name a few.
\*\*You need to enable transparency in some desktops.
\#\# 1-Planetary Eye Candy
Having one wallpaper usually gets a bit dull, the solution? You get xplanet! xplanet generates graphics of our small blue planet in set intervals (say every 10 minutes), also cloud cover is updated every three hours. Your desktop will serve as your own weather map! [Numerodix](http://www.matusiak.eu/numerodix/blog//index.php/2007/02/11/planetary-eyecandy/ "Numerodix") explains how xplanet is installed.
Desktop: KDE
Taskbars: top and bottom (no expansion)
Transparency: terminal only

\#\# 2-Marshmallow Hunting
This one is one of my favorites because it's very easy on the eye. The \[wallpaper\]\[1\] is slightly adjusted from the original one by [David Lanham](http://www.dlanham.com "David Lanham"). David has got a lot of other breathtaking artwork, make sure you check them out also!! The icons were provided bye [pokemonjojo2](http://www.mibhouse.org/pokemon_jojo/files/ICON-Somatic-0.1.1.tar.gz "pokemonjojo2").
Desktop: Gnome
Taskbars: top (no expansion) and Mac OSX style
Transparency: none

\#\# 3-Futuristic Gentoo
This one is a StarWarish-Pokemonish-Haloish desktop. The original wallpaper is taken from [Deviantart](http://chojindsl.deviantart.com/art/Gentoo-Red-Green-Blue-21731222 "deviantart"), while the upper and lower panel seem to be the regular GNOME panels with transparency. The [icons](http://mirrors.tds.net/gentoo/distfiles/gentoo-bubble-icons-20060811.tar.gz "icons") are also Gentoo.
Desktop: Gnome
Taskbars: top and bottom (no expansion)
Transparency: yes

\#\# 4-Even More Gentooish
This one is a jaw dropper, it just screams Gentoo! The icon theme is called [Lila](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Lila-Gnome?content=73971 "Lila") and can be found on [Gnome-Look](http://www.gnome-look.org "Gnome-Look"). The gauges on the right are obviously [gDesklets](http://www.gdesklets.de/ "gDesklets") , while the [wallpaper](http://nx57.deviantart.com/art/angel-61452162 "wallpaper") was created by [nx57](http://nx57.deviantart.com/ "nx57") from [Deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com "Deviantart").

Taskbars: top, bottom, and Mac OSX style
Transparency: yes

\#\# 5-Bart Goes Nude
Who doesn't love Bart? A kid that never seems to age or mature over the years. I included this desktop just because of the beauty of the picture. Just a simple \[wallpaper\]\[2\] and the [Gartoon icon set](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Gartoon+Icon+theme+%28v0.4.5%29?content=13527 "Gartoon icon set").
Desktop: Gnome
Taskbars: bottom (no expansion)
Transparency: none

\#\# 6-Agent Smith Meet KDE
No Linux desktop list is complete without a Matrix desktop! This cool wallpaper is by [\*timshinn73 from Deviantart](http://timshinn73.deviantart.com/art/Agent-Smith-Final-1848736 "*timshinn73 from Deviantart"). Icons are the the default KDE icon set and the widgets are obviously [SuperKaramba](http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/ "SuperKaramba"). While the gauges are \[gkrellm\]\[3\] (thanks to "me" for pointing this out)
Desktop: KDE
Taskbars: top and bottom (no expansion)
Transparency: none

\#\# 7-Hmmm...Portal?
This \[wallpaper\]\[4\] is taken from [Jamiroquai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamiroquai "Jamiroquai")'s video [Virtual Insanity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJmX1z1NY2c "Virtual Insanity"). But it just reminds me of the game [Portal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_%28video_game%29 "Portal") woot!!
Desktop: Gnome
Taskbars: top and bottom (no expansion)
Transparency: yes

[![](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/hmmportal.jpeg)](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/hmmportal.jpeg)
\#\# 8-CamelSnowMan
This one was done by [CamelSnowMan](http://camelsnowman.deviantart.com/ "CamelSnowMan") from [Deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com/ "Deviantart"), I just love the icon set! So simplistic! The [Snowman artwork](http://www.pixelgirlpresents.com/images/desktops/dim_po/Snow_Man_1600x1200.jpg "Snowman artwork") is done by [dim.po](http://dimpoart.deviantart.com/ "dim.po"). (I have scoured the net for the icons, I just can't find them! Does anybody know how to get them?)
Desktop: KDE
Taskbars: bottom (no expansion)
Transparency: none

\#\# 9-Fedora Sky
Ok ok ya this one is mine, but it sure is slick, right? I already have [featured](/blog/linux-general/i-just-installed-fedora-8/ "featured") it before when I first installed Fedora 8\. I used the default Fedora Core 8 wallpaper and a modified Fayal [Emerald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_%28window_decorator%29 "Emerald") theme.
Desktop: KDE
Taskbars: Bottom (no expansion)
Transparency: Yes

\#\# \#\# 10-Shrooms
This one is one of my favorite, dark and manageable! The \[wallpaper\]\[5\] is originally from \[digitalblasphemy\]\[6\]. The sidebar on the right also seems to SuperKaramba. While the gauges are \[gkrellm\]\[3\] (thanks to "me" for pointing this out)
Desktop: KDE
Tasbars: top (expansion) and bottom (no expansion)
Transparency: yes
