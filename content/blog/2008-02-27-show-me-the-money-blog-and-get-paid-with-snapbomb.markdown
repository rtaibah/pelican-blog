While stumbling today, I stumbled upon a [blog touting a new "blog and get paid"](http://www.infektia.net/snapbomb-get-paid-to-blog) website called [Snapbomb](http://snapbomb.com) which apparently has been creating some buzz. While the idea is definitely not novel, there are a lot of blog marketing websites out there. But hey it's my first crack at something like this! And so far so good. Here is why:

1- Your blog gets approved instantly, no need to wait for days or weeks. [Snapbomb](http://snapbomb.com) has an algorithm that quickly calculates your blog's stats and gives you a monetary range on how much you would be making per post.

2- After registration and getting evaluated, you are taken to the opportunity list. This by itself is a reason to sign up. There is never shortage in blogging ideas and this gives you a great boost.

3- You have 12 hours to finish your blog; and this is great in motivating. As I have a problem in getting off my ass and start writing :).

Getting on [snapbomb](http://snapbomb.com) early is something I would do if I were you, you never know when it becomes "the next big thing". And honestly, it looks like it's heading that way!
