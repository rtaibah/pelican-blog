Digg went down today! But that's not what really intrigued me. Digg had a "We'll Be Back Shortly" page with a recommended website from each staff member, but if you look closer, you will also see the Digg logo on the top and what seemingly is a server and a pixelated Debian logo!! This is the first time I witness a Digg downtime, so it might not be news, but for me it is! Was it done on purpose? I don't know. But it was obviously sloppily done!

In other news, I wonder what new features will they be adding now :P?
