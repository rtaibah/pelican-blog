Recently a \[Gizmodo\]\[1\] story got a lot of coverage on \[Digg\]\[2\] and other social news site, showing pictures of a \[Mac running 150 Apps and a teeny weeny dock\]\[3\]. Of course the Windows fanbois couldn't just stay silent and not prove that Mac ain't got shit against them, so Daniel Smith submitted a video showing[Vista running 108 apps,](http://gizmodo.com/377255/vista-running-108-apps-bites-back-mac-os-x-butt) with only 30% processor usage.
Of course us Linux geeks already know that if those two crappy pieces of bloatware could do it, then Linux will take that bet and raise a 100!! Here is a video of 165 apps running on Linux smoothly, with Desktop effects, rotating cubes, and switcher. Impressive!
