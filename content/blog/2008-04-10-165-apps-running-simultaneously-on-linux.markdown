Recently a [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com) story got a lot of coverage on [Digg](http://digg.com). and other social news site, showing pictures of a [Mac running 150 Apps and a teeny weeny dock](http://gizmodo.com/376497/mac-with-150-apps-running-shows-teeny+weeny-dock-expos-windows). Of course the Windows fanbois couldn't just stay silent and not prove that Mac ain't got shit against them, so Daniel Smith submitted a video showing [Vista running 108 apps,](http://gizmodo.com/377255/vista-running-108-apps-bites-back-mac-os-x-butt) with only 30% processor usage.

Of course us Linux geeks already know that if those two crappy pieces of bloatware could do it, then Linux will take that bet and raise a 100!! Here is a video of 165 apps running on Linux smoothly, with Desktop effects, rotating cubes, and switcher. Impressive!

_Update: Video is no longer available. [Here is the orignal link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaGpRIKCWSE)_
