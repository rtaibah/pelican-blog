Despite all it's faults and slip-ups, I absolutely love Digg. It has provided me great content, some inspiring, some funny, and others downright outrageous! But as any one would tell you, any social network is only as good as it's users, and Digg doesn't seem to be lacking on those. However, any great digger had a beginning, and most probably not a great one either.

I traced back the beginnings of the top 10 digg users according to [Chris Finke's list](http://www.chrisfinke.com/digg/topusers.html) (not sure how authentic it is, but hey at least I [am](http://digg.com/users/bianconeri4ever) on his 1000 list ![:P](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif) ) What were their first bases (submissions)? How about their first home runs (first page)? Ladies and gentlemen, strap your seatbelts, upon reaching 88 mph we are gonna generate 1.21 gigawatts and go back to the future, errrm I mean past...we are gonna find out:
