The ever so popular website and torrent tracker [Demonoid](http://www.demonoid.com) has been going through rough times in the past year. These freedom fighters fought nail and tooth to keep their servers up, they [relocated to several countries](http://torrentfreak.com/demonoid-tracker-moves-to-ukraine-080316/), they were [harassed by lawyers](http://torrentfreak.com/backdoor-to-banning-all-canadian-bittorrent-sites-071125/), and their administrator, Demios, [stepped down](http://torrentfreak.com/demonoid-to-be-resurrected-under-new-admin-080410/). It's no wonder the Internet rejoiced to [the news that it's back](http://torrentfreak.com/demonoid-is-back-080411/)! Life is beautiful again :)

Well maybe it's beautiful again for everybody except the Saudi pirates! [King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Abdulaziz_City_for_Science_&_Technology), the governing body that censors the Internet in the country, have so foolishly decided that [Demonoid](http://www.demonoid.com)'s content is not suitable for +20 million of it's citizens.

One has to wonder about the city's policy regarding torrents. [The Pirate Bay](http://www.thepiratebay.org) has been always been a distant dream for Saudis, only for it to be unblocked a couple of month ago. On the other hand, [Mininova](http://www.mininova.org) has always been attainable. I mean what's there on [Demonoid](http://www.demonoid.com) that's so corrupting that couldn't be found on these two mega trackers? The answer currently escapes me.

Thank god that we have some headless chickens regulating our tubes!

_Update: Demonoid is back, the censorship seems to be so arbitrary :S_
