The ever so popular website and torrent tracker [Demonoid](http://www.demonoid.com) has been going through rough times in the past year. These freedom fighters fought nail and tooth to keep their servers up, they \[relocated to several countries\]\[1\], they were [harassed by lawyers](http://torrentfreak.com/backdoor-to-banning-all-canadian-bittorrent-sites-071125/), and their administrator, Demios, [stepped down](http://torrentfreak.com/demonoid-to-be-resurrected-under-new-admin-080410/). It's no wonder the Internet rejoiced to [the news that it's back](http://torrentfreak.com/demonoid-is-back-080411/)! Life is beautiful again ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
Well maybe it's beautiful again for everybody except the Saudi pirates! \[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology\]\[2\], the governing body that censors the Internet in the country, have so foolishly decided that [Demonoid](http://www.demonoid.com)'s content is not suitable for +20 million of it's citizens.
One has to wonder about the city's policy regarding torrents. [The Pirate Bay](http://www.thepiratebay.org) has been always been a distant dream for Saudis, only for it to be unblocked a couple of month ago. On the other hand, [Mininova](http://www.mininova.org) has always been attainable. I mean what's there on [Demonoid](http://www.demonoid.com) that's so corrupting that couldn't be found on these two mega trackers? The answer currently escapes me.
Thank god that we have some headless chickens regulating our tubes!

Update: Demonoid is back, the censorship seems to be so arbitrary :S
