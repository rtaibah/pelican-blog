[Steven707](http://www.youtube.com/user/Steven707) seems to figured out how to run Crysis using Wine. Well almost! The game launches off perfectly, however during gameplay there are some glitches that makes the game almost unplayable. According to Steven, he had to tweak the registry a bit and use a few native Windows dll's just to get it to start. I hope he could give us more details on what exactly he did.

Now I am not really big on PC gaming, but what makes this special is the fact that Crysis is known to be very demanding when it comes to system resources, and running it un-natively is impressive itself. Wine has really improved by leaps and bounds over the years. Version 1.0.0 is just around the corner! W00T!
