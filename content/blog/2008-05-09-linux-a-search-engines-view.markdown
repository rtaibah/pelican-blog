In May's issue of [Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com), their segment "\*LJ Index" \*featured some tidbits or trends about which countries are actually Googling "Linux." It is always interesting where Linux is gaining public interest, which countries are falling behind. (Source: \[Google Trends\]\[1\])
\* \*Russia\* claimed the top spot
\* \*India\* came in second
\* Number of Asian countries in the top ten: \*\*3\*\*
\* Number of European countries in the top ten: \*\*7\*\*
\* Number of North American countries in the top ten: \*\*\*\*
\* Position of \*Russian \*among all languages: \*\*1\*\*

[![Russia ranked first; while India came in second](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/country-linux-usage.png).](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/country-linux-usage.png)

**I then decided to play around with Google trends on my own, here are some interesting results:**

* **Recently, the two terms "Ubuntu" and "Linux" became almost at par:**

* **Over the years "Microsoft" and "Linux" are almost at par; with a slight edge for Microsoft since 2005:**
