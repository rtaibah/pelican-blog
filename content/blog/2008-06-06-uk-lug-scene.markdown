In the latest [Linux Format magazine](http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/), they featured a full map of the UK [LUG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_User_Group) scene. I found this could be helpful for my UK readers. So I emailed them and asked for a copy of the map, and they happily provided it! Thanks LFX! You guys kick ass!

If you are a UK resident, I urge you to find the nearest LUG in your area and contact them. Get involved!
