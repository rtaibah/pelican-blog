While I am not really big iPhone fan, I must admit it's a sexy piece of hardware, that captured the hearts of millions in a heartbeat. But the fact that Apple decided to lock it down, is a deal breaker for me. I have had the misfortune of buying a 32 GB iPod touch, and managing it from my Ubuntu box is simply a **nightmare**. While tools like _ipod-convenience_, can do the job, they are buggy and unstable to say the least and remain indivisual efforts of Linux hackers and reverse engineers.

Anyways now that I got that off my chest. The App store is already in business, but thats not what really concerns us over here. With this new store comes a new app that at least gives us Open Source enthusiasts a life line. The leading Open Source development website, [SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net) has announced today the release of its application 'SFNetNews' via the newly opened iTunes store, which will enable users to read news from [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.com), install alerts about the latest apps from [Freshmeat](http://www.freshmeat.net), browse [Thinkgeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com)! The price? Free of course!

Whether SFNetNews can be installed using the Installer of a jailbroken unit is yet to be seen.

Here is the official press release: [SourceForge Releases iPhone Application](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/sourceforge-releases-iphone-application/story.aspx?guid={D8C44F20-C3A1-4455-BDD5-E2CEB06B373E}&dist=hppr)

And the official community blog: [SourceForge on the iPhone?](http://sourceforge.net/community/sourceforge-on-the-iphone/)

**EDIT**: I have tried several times to upgrade my iPod Touch using several guides out there, but to no avail. Apprently I haven't read the fine print, and thus far the upgrade works only on iPhones (which I don't own). So if anybody out there gets the chance to upgrade and install SFNetNews, could you either comment or contact me for a screenshot?

**UPDATE**: My contact at SourceForge answered my question about installing SFNetNews without the iTunes store, and it's a negative.
