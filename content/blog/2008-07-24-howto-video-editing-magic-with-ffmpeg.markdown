ffmpeg is a very powerful tool to edit your videos, I would wager that it's all you will ever need. Unforunately ffmpeg is somewhat cumbersome, and I admit it isn't really "top of mine" when I want to convert video files. I usually go around googling for GUI tools and totally forget about this tool, and when I do remember it, I am awfully intimidated by it. I am sure I am not alone on this :).

[LinuxJournal](http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/linux-howto-video-editing-magic-ffmpeg) has provided us a wonderful video explaining how to use this powerful command line tool. So fear not anymore, this video will provide you the basic steps to video editing nirvana!
