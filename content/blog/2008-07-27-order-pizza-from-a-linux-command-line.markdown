summary: Linux beginners are usually advised to learn the command line, or at least I usually pass out that advice. There is probably nothing you can't do using a terminal, you just need to know what you are doing. Hell you can even order your own Pizza!

Linux beginners are usually advised to learn the command line, or at least I usually pass out that advice. There is probably nothing you can't do using a terminal, you just need to know what you are doing. Hell you can even order your own Pizza!

[Cory Arcangel](http://www.beigerecords.com/cory/) and Michael Frumin created a Linux command line app to help you order from Domino's called [Pizza Party](http://www.beigerecords.com/cory/pizza_party/). Here are some important points about the app:

* Can order pizza with only a few keystrokes.
* Can save pizza preferences.
* Can use batch files for ordering many pizzas.
* Has easy to use flags for ordering different toppings.
* Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems.
* Supports most currently popular topings like "mushrooms", and "pepperoni"!
* Unattended / background operation.
* Pizza Party is distributed under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
