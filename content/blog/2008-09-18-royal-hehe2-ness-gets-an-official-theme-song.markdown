I woke up today finding a shared Facebook link from my cousins, and boy was I in for a pleasant surprise! A comment was included with the link by Hani:

> Hehe2 hehe2....so yea me and Yassir were sitting here minding our own business and then whadya know, right there on tv was the ultimate "Hehe2 video! we suggest finding a way to play this as a theme for linuxologist.com ;)

And I will not FAIL! So without further ado, I give you the official Royal HeHe2-ness theme song! Now all I need to do is [strip the audio from this youtube video]({filename}/blog/2008-03-10-downloading-music-the-1337-way.markdown) to use it as a ringtone. Wohoooo...errrmmm I mean Hehe2 Hehe2....
  
**This video is unforunately no longer on Youtube**
