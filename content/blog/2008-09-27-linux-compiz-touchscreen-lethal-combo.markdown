Touchscreens existed for quite some time. I knew they did, you knew they did, everybody knew they did. So why the **hell** have I not seen these videos before? I feel almost ashamed that these were uploaded back in 2006! Am really disappointed in myself, I think I need to improve my Interwebs kung fu! _\*moving into a fetal position\*_
