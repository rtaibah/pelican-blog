I am pleased to introduce to you a new contributor to Royal HeHe2-ness. Ian Mclean is an Australian Linux and Open Source Aficianado currently based in Romania. He is an amatuer web developer and a music artist in his spare time. Ian jumped on the Linux wagon in 2005 (about the same time as me). He completely made his switch to the penguin this year! Good luck Ian ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
You might have already read Ian's first blog on Royal HeHe2-ness, the widely popular "[Why DRM Should be Kicked to The Curb](/blog/drm/why-its-time-to-kick-drm-to-the-curb/)". Personally I enjoy reading his articles, I hope you do to!
