[La Tour Eiffel](http://jraf.org/code-latoureiffel/content.xml) is an Android application develeoped by [Benoît Lubek](http://jraf.org/). It basically captures a live shot of the Eiffel tower in Paris, France and plasters it as your wallpaper on your Android phone. The updates are done every 30 minutes, and the shots are amazing! Its really fun seeing the Eiffel tower glowing at night and posing in all its glory under daylight.

It would be interesting to see the way forward with this app. One thing that comes to mind is "crowdsourcing" it. There are 1000's of landmarks around the world, and am sure its pretty easy to set up a webcam that uploads images to a certain URL every X amount of minutes. According to Benoît he only needs 640×455 images. It would be great if we can get the Grand Canyon, Empire State, Pyramids of Giza...etc under this app. Of course we will need to change its name then :).
