Its been quite sometime since I posted on Royal Linuxing, and deep down I feel really guilty.  For a year and a half I have been committed to this blog, it consumed quite a big chunk of my day.
The thing is, a lot has been going on in my life. For starters, I resigned from my job, decided to continue my graduate studies, and relocating half way across the world. As of next week I'll be in Boston, MA ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
I have very big plans for "Royal Linuxing", and\[ it isn't a secret that I am not too fond of the "linuxologist.com" domain\]\[1\], I already made it clear that it was an impulsive choice one late boring night.\*\* So I have decided to migrate this blog to a much cooler domain! FOSSCRUNCH.COM Linuxologist.com!\*\* Naturally "Royal Linuxing" will become "FossCrunch" "The Linuxologist." Hope you guys like the name, I am always ready to hear your opinion ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
I will also be working on a totally new design for the blog, that will be related to Linux instead of this generic theme I have now.
Sadly, with all this going on, I think it would be hard to bring new and fresh content. Most of my posts require a lot of research and experimentation. Since I will never recommend something unless I tried it myself and can verify that it does work.
Of course,\*\* I am more than happy to publish any guest posts offered to me. So if you ever played around with the idea of blogging but never really took action. Here is your chance\*\*. Get published on linuxologist.com! And as an added bonus, I will personally submit your blog to Digg or get a power user to submit it. More exposure for you!!
So stay tuned, there is really great stuff just around the corner! ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
