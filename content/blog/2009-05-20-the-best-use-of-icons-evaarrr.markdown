So it has been over a month since my last post and me [moving to America](/blog/off-topic/big-changes-for-royal-linuxing-and-me/), and my only connection to the world is a measly Dell mini 12 netbook that Intel somehow severely screwed up when it comes to Linux video drivers. The situation isn't exactly inspiring me to blog and do all the other activities that it entails. A molasses Firefox is driving me crazy, makes me want to chuck this netbook out of the window....Netbooks are NOT for everyday use! Luckily, my[Lenovo Thinkpad is on its way](http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/systemconfig.runtime.workflow:LoadRuntimeTree?sb=:00000025:00001CC8:&smid=0A759CA6FAC74C46BC91C724ECD09BA7).
But I guess I had to pop up eventually, since a lot of readers were starting to ask when am coming back.
So while treading the amazing world of Twitter (follow me [@rtaibah](http://twitter.com/rtaibah)), I found a hilarious picture posted by [Nixie Pixel ](http://www.nixiepixel.com/blog//)(twitter:[@nixiepixel](http://www.twitter.com/nixiepixel), follow her, HOT HOT HOT :P)

Its a screenshot taken from an Open Source video-ediing tool called Cinelerra. I can't really vouch for it (yet!), but it has been featured on FLOSS Weekly with Leo Laporte just this past week. Interesting episode, [make sure you catch it](http://twit.tv/floss68)!
