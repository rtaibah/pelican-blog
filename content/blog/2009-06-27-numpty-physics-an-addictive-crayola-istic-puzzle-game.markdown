Gaming in Linux has come a long way, last February, we covered [World of Goo]({filename}/blog/2009-02-16-world-of-goo-an-eye-popping-game-ported-to-linux.markdown). World of Goo captured headlines because it's originally a Nintendo Wii game but the developers have decided to port it to Linux. Anyways, if you liked World of Goo, then you will LOVE  [Numpty Physics](http://numptyphysics.garage.maemo.org/):


> Harness gravity with your crayon and set about creating blocks, ramps, levers, pulleys and whatever else you fancy to get the little red thing to the little yellow thing.

Here see it in action:


So far, I really love the simplicity and the physics behind Numpty Physics. If there is one thing I would change (or add) is a soundtrack. It sometimes feels creepily annoying when playing this with no music and/or sound effects.

_Numpty Physics is available for Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX, and Windows! It is built on the Box2D engine and released under GPL_
