Linux is pretty stable, it doesn't really need to be rebooted twice a day like another operating system that shall remain unnamed. Thats one of the reasons [Linux is installed on 19 of the 20 top supercomputers in the world](http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/06/24/the-triumph-of-linux-as-a-supercomputer-os/). However, with Kernel updates you will always need to reboot. Who needs that? Enter Ksplice!

Ksplice's [press release](http://www.ksplice.com/news/20090625-linuxtag-fisl) announced free support for consumers running the latest version of Ubuntu Linux OS:

> In order to demonstrate this technology, Ksplice will begin offering a free demonstration version of its rebootless update service, called Ksplice Uptrack, to consumers running the latest version of the Ubuntu Linux operating system.  Computers that are signed up for the Ksplice Uptrack service will receive the same important security updates as other machines, but they will not need to reboot in order to install the updates.

You can download Ksplice from their [download page](http://www.ksplice.com/uptrack/). Also, if you are interested in the inner working of Ksplice, here is their [technical paper [PDF]](http://www.ksplice.com/doc/ksplice.pdf).
