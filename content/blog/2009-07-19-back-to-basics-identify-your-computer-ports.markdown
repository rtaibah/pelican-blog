Martin Owens over at [DoctorMo's blog](http://doctormo.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/learning-identifying-computer-ports/) designed an impressive set of visuals detailing a wide range of computer ports. Any self-respecting geek should know these, they do come in handy from time to time:
\[![common-ports](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/common-ports.png)\]\[1\]
\* [**Serial Port**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Port):\*\* \*\*A serial communication physical interface through which information transfers in or out one bit at a time
\* [**PS/2 Connector:**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_connector) Is used for connecting some keyboards and mice to a PC compatible computer system. Its name comes from the [IBM Personal System/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2 "IBM Personal System/2") series of personal computer\*\*s\*\*
\* \*\*[Parallel Port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Port)\*\*: Sends several data signals simultaneously over several parallel channels (as opposed to the Serial Port)
\* [**Games Port**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_port): The traditional connector for video game input devices on [x86](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86 "X86")-based PCs
\* All these ports have been replaced by [USB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usb)

\* \*\*[Ethernet/RJ45](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ45): \*\*Martin's illustration calls this RJ45, however according to Wikipedia, this is incorrect and should be called 8P8C (8 Position 8 Contact.) They are usedtypically used to \[terminate\]\[2\] \[twisted pair\]\[3\] cab\*\*le\*\*
\* \*\*[Modem/RJ11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ11)\*\*: a physical interface often used for terminating telephone wires

\* [**S-Video**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video): \*\*Separate\*\* \*\*V\*\*ideo (not Super Video) carries the video data as two separate signals, \*lumen\* (luminance) and \*chroma\* (color)
\* \*\*[HDMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI)\*\*: \*\*H\*\*igh \*\*D\*\*efinition \*\*M\*\*ultimedia \*\*I\*\*nterface is a compact audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed digital data
\* \*\*[DVI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface): D\*\*igital \*\*V\*\*ideo \*\*I\*\*nterface is a video interface standard designed to provide very high visual quality on digital display devices such as flat panel LCD computer displays and digital projector\*\*s\*\*
\* [**Mini-DVI**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-DVI): This connector is used on Apple computers as a digital alternative to the \[Mini-VGA\]\[4\] connector
\* [**Micro-DVI**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-dvi): This port is a video connection port used by some Apple MacBook Air laptop computers produced between January-October 2008

\* \*\*Audio Mini-Jacks Sockets\*\* are self-explainable, you can find more comprehensive description of this interface [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_jack)
\* [**S/PDIF**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/PDIF): Or \*\*S\*\*ony/\*\*P\*\*hillips \*\*D\*\*igital \*\*I\*\*nterconnect \*\*F\*\*ormat

[![firewire-ports](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/firewire-ports.png)](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/firewire-ports.png)
\* [**Firewire 400MB/s**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireWire_400): Can transfer data between devices at 100, 200, or 400 Mbit/s \[half-duplex\]\[5\] data rates
\* [**Firewire 800Mb/s**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireWire_800#FireWire_800_.28IEEE_1394b-2002.29): Can transfer data at a rate of 786.432 Mbit/s \[full-duplex\]\[6\]

\* \*\*[C5 / C6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_connector#C5_and_C6_connectors)\*\*: "Cloverleaf" or "Mickey Mouse" power connectors can be seen on the majority of laptop power supplies and portable projectors
\* [**C7 / C8**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_connector#C7_and_C8_connectors): C7 is also sometimes called "Shotgun." These connectors can be found on  cassette recorders, battery/mains operated radios, some full size AV equipment, laptop computer power supplies, video game consoles
\* \[\*\*C13/C14\*\*\]\[7\]: C14 is used as an inlet to attach the power cord to the power supply, as do many monitors, printers and other peripherals. While many older computers also provide a panel-mounting C13 outlet for powering the monitor

[![usb-ports](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/usb-ports.png)](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/usb-ports.png)
\* [**USB-A**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#USB-A): This kind of plug is most frequently seen on cables that are permanently attached to a device, such as one on a cable that connects a keyboard or mouse to the computer
\* [**USB-B**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#USB-B): Typically plugs into an upstream receptacle on a device that uses a removable cable, e.g. a printer
\* [**Mini-A & Mini-B**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Mini_and_Micro): Mini-A is now deprecated, but both these plugs are plugs are approximately 3 by 7 mm. These are used in PDA's, mobile phone, and cameras
\* \[\*\*Micro-B\*\*\]\[8\]: Micro plugs have a similar width as the Mini's but approximately half the thickness. These enable integration into thinner portable devices.
\* [**Micro-AB**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go): This receptacle is capable of accepting either a Micro-A plug or a Micro-B plug
