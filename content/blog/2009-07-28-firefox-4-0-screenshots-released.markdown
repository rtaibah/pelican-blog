Just a month ago Mozilla gave us the final version of Firefox 3.5 giving us a lot of nifty features like HTML5, private browsing, smarter session control among others. But Mozilla aren't the kind of people who sit on their laurels, they already posted [screenshots of Firefox 3.7](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/3.7_Windows_Theme_Mockups) a week ago, and today we have [Mozilla Firefox 4.0 screenshots](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups)!
Unfortunately the screenshots are for Windows, none for Linux yet. Also, they warned that these are just a draft for exploration and/or brainstorming.
Basically they are pondering two GUI changes. Tabs location and a combo Stop/Refresh/Go Button.
\#\# Tabs Location: Top or Bottom?
Should tabs be "Tabs-on-Bottom," or the current setting

Or should they be "Tab-on-Top", or Ã  la Google Chrome

**Positives**

* **Save Vertical Space**
* **Efficiency/Remove Visual Complexity** -- Right now the tabs have to be connected to something. So we are adding an extra visual element for them to connect to.
* **Shorter Mouse Distance to Page Controls**

**Negatives**

* **Breaks Consistency/Familiarity** -- Moving things confuses existing users.
* **Title is MIA** -- With the space removed from the titlebar you only get the truncated version in the tab.
* **Longer Mouse Distance to Tabs** -- Takes longer to mouse to a tab.
* **Lost Space** -- Sandwiched in between the application icon and the window widgets you lose some space.

Personally, I am not a fan of this implementation. The MIA title problem really does irk me. However, why not leave both options for users? Any thoughts?

## Combo Stop/Refresh/Go Button

This one seems pretty logical. Why have separate stop, refresh, and go buttons? If you are typing a url, the button will change into a **green go** button, while its loading that same button would change into a **red stop **button, and once a page is fully loaded the button changes into a **regular refresh button**.

Remember, these are just proposed, and like any Open Source project, the feedback from the community plays a big role in the final product.
