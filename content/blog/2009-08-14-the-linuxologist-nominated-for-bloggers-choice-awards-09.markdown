A reader of The Linuxologist was passionate enough to nominate us for a [Blogger's Choice Award '09](http://bloggerschoiceawards.com) for the best Geek Blog. We really feel honored by this nomination, and if you do enjoy the blog we would really appreciate it if you would take the time to vote for The Linuxologist.

Unfortunately, the awards website requires you to create your own credentials. Wish that they had a Facebook or Twitter connect option, but they don't. Still it would take you less than two minutes to [sign up](http://bloggerschoiceawards.com/users/signup) and [vote](http://bloggerschoiceawards.com/blog/s/show/78787).

But just to make things interesting, and motivate you geeks to actually sign up and vote, **The Linuxologist will give out $20 Amazon coupon to a random lucky winner!** The odds are really good!

Here is your chance to win and advocate Linux and Open Source, so what are you waiting for? [VOTE!](http://bloggerschoiceawards.com/blog/s/show/78787)
