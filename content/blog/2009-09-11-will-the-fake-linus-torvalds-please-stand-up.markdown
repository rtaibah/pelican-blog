Inspired by the popular [Fake Steve Jobs blog](http://www.fakesteve.net/), The Linux Foundation invited 4 prominent Linux industry leaders to guest tweet as Linus Torvalds. Users are invited to vote for their favorite fake Linus. The winner and all 4 fake Linus Trovalds will be revealed at [LinuxCon 2009](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon).

They also made a hilarious promotion video parodying Eminem's "Please Stand Up" video:

> Chuck Norris dubs Linus a hero. He can divide by zero. He can do an infinite loop in a milli-sec, and round-house Chuck Norris in the neck! The code Linus writes is always bug free!
