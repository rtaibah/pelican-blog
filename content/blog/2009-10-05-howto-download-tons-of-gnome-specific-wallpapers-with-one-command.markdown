Gnome-look.org has tons of wallpapers to decorate your favorite desktop. However the website isn't really friendly to download them all. You have to go through a long list of wallpapers, click through each and download the wallpaper from the wallpaper page. Luckily, with the power of the command terminal and ftp you can get tons of wallpapers with a single command!

First you need to create a directory in your home directory, lets call it Wallpapers 

     mkdir ~/Wallpapers

Now you need to connect to gnome.org ftp servers 

    ftp ftp.gnome.org

Next you will be asked to enter a username and password. "anonymous" will be your username and just press enter when prompted for the password. 

Now lets navigate to the wallpapers on their servers 

    cd /pub/GNOME/teams/art.gnome.org/backgrounds

You will also need to turn prompting off, you don't want it bugging you asking you if you want to download each single file 

    prompt off 

Now lets download all 1280×1024 (assuming thats your resolution) 

    mget \*1280x1024.jpg

Great huh? Now why don't you rotate your wallpapers? Here check our [3 Great Ways To Rotate Your Linux Desktop](/2009/03/3-great-ways-to-rotate-your-linux-desktop/)  article.
