# My Personal Review

I found this book to be very valuable in terms of the methods and motivation it provides, unfortunately the real gems are cluttered within self-promotion of the author, anectodes, and examples. The real meat of the book can be summarized in 10-20 pages. 

# Book Summary

The premise of the book is simple:

> Focused, productive, successful mornings generate focused, productive, successful days—which inevitably create a successful life—in the same way that unfocused, unproductive, and mediocre mornings generate unfocused, unproductive, and mediocre days, and ultimately a mediocre quality of life. By simply changing the way you wake up in the morning, you can transform any area of your life, faster than you ever thought possible.”


## Causes of Medicrity

### Rear View Mirror Syndrome

According to the Social Security Administration, if you take any 100 people at the start of their working careers and follow them for the next 40 years until they reach retirement age, here’s what you’ll find:  only 1 will be wealthy; 4 will be financially secure; 5 will continue working, not because they want to but because they have to; 36 will be dead; and 54 will be broke and dependent on friends, family, relatives, and the government to take care of them.

Our subconscious minds are equipped with a self-limiting rearview mirror, through which we continuously relive and recreate our past. We mistakenly believe that who we were is who we are, thus limiting our true potential in the present, based on the limitations of our past”

The average person thinks somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000 thoughts. The problem is that ninety-five percent of our thoughts are the same as the ones we thought the day before, and the day before that, and the day before that. It’s no wonder most people go through life, day after day, month after month, year after year, and never change the quality of their lives.

### Lack of Purpose

The average person takes life one day at a time, and has no higher purpose beyond merely surviving. Most people just focus on getting through the day, taking the path of least resistance, and pursuing short term, short-lived pleasures along the way, while avoiding any pain or discomfort that might cause them to grow.

To defeat this cause of mediocrity, you need a life purpose, which can be any purpose you want. It can be anything that resonates with and inspires you to wake up every day and live in alignment with your purpose.

Keep in mind that you can change your life purpose at any time. As you grow and evolve, so will your purpose. What’s important is that you choose a purpose—any purpose—and start living by it.

### Isolating Incidents

We do this when we mistakenly assume that each choice we make, and each individual action we take, is only affecting that particular moment, or circumstance. For example, you may think it’s no big deal to miss a workout, procrastinate on a project, or eat fast food because you’ll get a “do-over” tomorrow. You make the mistake of thinking that skipping that workout only affects that incident, and you’ll make a better choice next time. Nothing could be farther from the truth.

Another example, when the alarm clock goes off, and we hit the snooze button (the easy thing), most people mistakenly assume that this action is only affecting that moment. The reality is that this type of action is programming our subconscious mind with the instructions that it is okay for us to not follow through with the things we intended to do.

### Lack of Accounatability

Vegetables got eaten, homework was completed, teeth were brushed, we bathed and got to bed at a reasonable hour. If it weren’t for the accountability provided for us by our parents and teachers, we would have been uneducated, malnourished, sleep-deprived, dirty little kids! Nice way to reframe it, right?
 
Accountability has brought order to our lives and allowed us to progress, improve and achieve results we wouldn’t have otherwise. Here’s the problem:  accountability was never something you and I asked for, but rather something that we endured as children, teens, and young adults. As it was forced upon us by adults, most of us unconsciously grew to resist and resent accountability altogether. Then, when we turned 18, we embraced every ounce of freedom we could get our hands on, continuing to avoid accountability like it was the plague, perpetuating a downward spiral into mediocrity, developing detrimental mindsets and habits such as laziness, deflecting responsibility, and taking short cuts—hardly a recipe for success.

### Mediocre Circle of Influence

Research has shown that we virtually become like the average of the five people we spend the most time with.

### Lack of Personal Development

Most of us aren’t investing time each day into developing ourselves into the “Level 10” people that we need to be that are capable of attracting, creating, living, and sustaining the levels of success that we say we want. As a result, we struggle to attain the levels of health, happiness, energy, love, personal and professional success that we truly desire.

### Lack of Urgency

Now matters more than any other time in your life, because it’s what you are doing today that is determining who you’re becoming, and who you’re becoming will always determine the quality and direction of your life.

## The Truth About Waking Up

Consider that what you’re actually doing is resisting your life. Every time you hit the snooze button, you’re in a state of resistance to your day, to your life, and to waking up and creating the life you say you want.

We need as much sleep as we believe that we need. 

For example, if you believe that you need 8 hours of sleep to feel rested, but you’re getting into bed at 12:00 midnight and have to wake up at 6:00 a.m., you’re likely to tell yourself, “Geez, I’m only going to get six hours of sleep tonight, but I need eight. I’m going to feel exhausted in the morning.” Then, what happens as soon as your alarm clock goes off and you open your eyes and you realize it’s time to wake up?  What’s the first thought that you think? It’s the same thought you had before bed!  “Geez, I only got six hours of sleep. I feel exhausted.”  It’s a self-fulfilling, self-sabotaging prophecy. If you tell yourself you’re going to feel tired in the morning, then you are absolutely going to feel tired. If you believe that you need 8 hours to feel rested, then you’re not going to feel rested on anything less. But what if you changed your beliefs?

What I found was that whether I got nine, eight, seven, six, five, or even just four hours of sleep, as long as I consciously decided, before bed, that I was getting the perfect amount of sleep—that the hours were going to energize my body to feel wonderful in the morning—I consistently woke feeling better than I ever had before. However, don’t take my word for it. I encourage you to experiment with this yourself.

Here are the 5 steps for a snooze-proof strategy:

1- Set your intentions before bed: The key is to consciously decide every night to actively and mindfully create a positive expectation for the next morning. "4 hours of sleep! Awesome, that is more than enough for me to be energized in the morning"

2- Move your clock across the room

3- Brush your teeth

4- Drink a full glass of water

5- Get dressed in your exercise cloth, and start exercising!

## Life S.A.V.E.R.S

Life SAVERS is basically 6 practices that will provide you with life-enhancing and life-challenging daily routines or rituals. Each one develops you physically, mentally, spiritually or emotionally.

### S for Silence

Purposeful Silence. “Purposeful” simply means that you are engaging in a period of Silence with a highly beneficial purpose in mind—not just for the heck of it. As Matthew Kelly so eloquently states in his bestselling book The Rhythm of Life, “You can learn more in an hour of silence than you can in a year from books.”  That’s a powerful statement from a very wise man.
 
If you want to immediately reduce your stress levels, to begin each day with the kind of calm, clarity, and peace of mind that will allow you to stay focused on what’s most important in your life, and even dance on the edge of enlightenment—do the opposite of what most people do—start every morning with a period of purposeful Silence.

Meditate, Pray, Reflect!

### A for Affirmation

Affirmations are one of the most effective tools for quickly becoming the person you need to be to achieve everything you want in your life. Affirmations allow you to design and then develop the mindset (thoughts, beliefs, focus) that you need to take any area of your life to the next level.

When you actively design and write out your affirmations to be in alignment with what you want to accomplish and who you need to be to accomplish it—and commit to repeating them daily (ideally out loud)—they immediately make an impression on your subconscious mind. Your affirmations go to work to transform the way you think and feel so you can overcome your limiting beliefs and behaviors and replace them with those you need to succeed.

Or as Henry For said "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're either way right"

In order to write down your affirmations:

1- What do you really want?
2- Why do you want it?
3- Whom you are committed to being in order to create it?
4- What you're committed to doing to attain it?
5- Add inspirational quotes and philosophies

### V for Visualizations

Will Smith stated that he used visualization to overcome challenges, and visualized his success years before actually becoming successful. Another famous example is actor Jim Carrey, who wrote himself a check in 1987 in the amount of 10 million dollars. He dated it for “Thanksgiving 1995” and added in the memo line, “For acting services rendered.”  He then visualized it for years, and in 1994 he was paid 10 million dollars for his starring role in Dumb & Dumber.

Visualizing your goals and dreams is believed by some experts to attract your visions into your life. Whether or not you believe in the law of attraction, there are practical applications for visualization. When you visualize what you want, you stir up emotions that lift your spirits and pull you towards your vision. The more vividly you see what you want, and the more intensely you allow yourself to experience now the feelings you will feel once you’ve achieved your goal, the more you make the possibility of achieving it feel real.

After I’ve read my affirmations, I sit upright on my living room couch, close my eyes, and take a few slow, deep breaths. For the next five minutes, I simply visualize myself living my ideal day, performing all of my tasks with ease, confidence, and enjoyment.

### E for Exercise

Morning exercise should be a staple in your daily rituals. When you exercise for even a few minutes every morning it significantly boosts your energy, enhances your health, improves self-confidence and emotional well-being, and enables you to think better and concentrate longer

### R for Reading

The key is to learn from the experts—those who have already done what you want to do. Don’t reinvent the wheel. The fastest way to achieve everything you want is to model successful people who have already achieved it. With an almost infinite amount of books available on every topic, there are no limits to the knowledge you can gain through daily reading.

### S for Scribing

By getting your thoughts out of your head and putting them in writing, you gain valuable insights you’d otherwise never see. The Scribing element of your morning enables you to document your insights, ideas, breakthroughs, realizations, successes, and lessons learned, as well as any areas of opportunity, personal growth, or improvement.

## Why People Fail in Changing Habits

One of the primary reasons most people fail to create and sustain new habits is because they don’t know what to expect, and they don’t have a winning strategy. 

_The author argues that 30 days can change any habit if you have the right strategy_:

### [Days 1-10] Phase One: Unbearable

The problem for most people is that they don’t realize that this seemingly unbearable first 10 days is only “temporary.” Instead, they think it’s the way the new habit feels, and will always feel, telling themselves:  If the new habit is this painful, forget it—it’s not worth it.

So, the first 10 days of implementing any new habit aren’t a picnic. You’ll defy it. You might even hate it at times. But you can do it. Especially considering, it only gets easier from here, and the reward is, oh—just the ability to create everything you want for your life.


### [Days 11-20] Phase One: Uncomfortable

At this stage it will still be tempting to fall back to your old behaviors. Referencing the example of waking up early as your new habit, it will still be easier to sleep in because you’ve done it for so long. Stay committed. You’ve already gone from Unbearable to Uncomfortable.


### [Days 11-20] Phase One: Unstoppable

Phase Three is also where the actual transformation occurs, as your new habit becomes part of your identity. It transcends the space between something you’re trying and who you’re becoming. You start to see yourself as someone who lives the habit.

## The Email That Will Change Your Life

> “Dear friends, family, and colleagues: 

> Thank you so much for reading this email. This isn’t an easy one for me to send, but it is extremely important to me, so I sincerely appreciate you investing your valuable time reading (and hopefully responding to) it.

> This email is going out to only a select group of people. Each of you knows me well, and I’m hoping will give me honest feedback about my strengths and most importantly, my weaknesses (aka “areas of improvement.”)

> I’ve never done anything like this before, but I feel that for me grow and improve as a person, I need to get a more accurate picture of how I’m showing up to the people that matter most to me. In order to become the person I need to be to create the life and contribute to others at the levels that I want, I need your feedback.

> So, all I’m asking is that you take just a few minutes to email me back with what you honestly think are my top 2-3 “areas of improvement.” If it will make you feel better to also list my top 2-3 “strengths” (I’m sure it will make me feel better J), you are definitely welcome to. That’s it. And please don’t sugarcoat it or hold back anything. I will not be offended by anything that you share. In fact, the more “brutally” honest you are, the more leverage it will give me to make positive changes in my life.

> Thank you again, and if there is anything else I can do to add value to your life, please let me know.

> With sincere gratitude,

> Your Name
