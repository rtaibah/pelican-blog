## Review

 I have a love/hate relationship with this book. I really enjoyed reading about OASIS, the virtual world the author built and the possibilities it offers. Cline did a great job in imagining a virtual world that we can actually build today with the current technology we have. As a technologist, OASIS set my imagination free. This perhaps is the most single factor that allowed me to really enjoy this book.

 However, I felt that the 80's references were a bit too much. To a level where it felt that the author was just bragging about his deep knowledge of the 70's and 80's. The characters were somewhat flat and two-dimensional, with no character advancement whatsoever. I kept expecting plot-twists at every corner, there were none. Maybe that's a meta-plot-twist right there, but still the progress of the story felt a bit too linear.

 All in all, it's a fun book to read. If you are a video gamer, like sci-fi, or love the 80's pick this one up. It's a simple read and you will easily finish it in a sitting or two.


 ## Protips:

 - Keep wikipedia/youtube handy, looking up the references will enhance your enjoyment of the book. Also if the reference is to obscure (i.e no Wikipedia article dedicated to it,) just skip it.
