</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Social news websites are all the rave these days on web land, the basic idea is that users submit their news stories and then the community votes up or down. While such sites provide you with new and fresh content daily, but when it comes to breaking news it royally fails. For example, <a href="http://digg.com/general_sciences/Happy_Pi_Day_10">this year's Pi day</a>, which is celebrated on the 14th of March, reached to Digg's first page on the 15th where I live and the evening of the 14th in America. So in reality, Digg missed half the world by a day, and the other half had a late celebration.
Mixx, has found a way around this problem. It recently announced the introduction of the [breaking news function][1]. So how does it work? Well <a href="http://blog/.mixx.com/2008/02/19/adding-more-ingredients-to-the-mixx-related-content/">SuperMixxers</a> can flag a certain story as "breaking", and if two SuperMixxers flag a story, then it's moved to the Breaking section. Breaking News stories only remain present as "breaking" for a limited number of time... and only a limited amount of stories can be present in the breaking section at any given time. A very simple solution to a seemingly unconquerable problem!
Now while Digg has been promising us for ages a new comment system, which is pretty much a basic need, Mixx has been throwing at as loads of intuitive and creative ideas never seen before on the social news arena. First they introduced the ["related story" function][2] and now this. I don't know if Digg has become bankrupt of ideas, just don't care anymore, or the site has become to big for them to handle.
Now on paper this very much sound perfect, and I really do believe that Mixx could pull it off. The Mixx community is very much against spam, and would probably call out any SuperMixxers who abuse this function. However, in interest of transparency I really do hope that Mixx starts to show which SuperMixxer actually flagged a story as "breaking". This way SuperMixxers are accountable for their breaking flags, and would have to answer to the community if something sketchy is going on <img alt=":)" src="http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" />
