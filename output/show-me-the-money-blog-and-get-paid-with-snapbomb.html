</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>While stumbling today, I stumbled upon a [blog touting a new "blog and get paid"][1] website called [Snapbomb][2] which apparently has been creating some buzz. While the idea is definitely not novel, there are a lot of blog marketing websites out there. But hey it's my first crack at something like this! And so far so good. Here is why:
1-Your blog gets approved instantly, no need to wait for days or weeks. [Snapbomb ][2]has an algorithm that quickly calculates your blog's stats and gives you a monetary range on how much you would be making per post.
2-After registration and getting evaluated, you are taken to the opportunity list. This by itself is a reason to sign up. There is never shortage in blogging ideas and this gives you a great boost.
3-You have 12 hours to finish your blog; and this is great in motivating. As I have a problem in getting off my ass and start writing <img alt=":)" src="http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /> .
Getting on [snapbomb][2] early is something I would do if I were you, you never know when it becomes "the next big thing". And honestly, it looks like it's heading that way!
