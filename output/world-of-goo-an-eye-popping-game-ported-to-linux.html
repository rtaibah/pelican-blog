I consider myself a gamer. Luckily I am a console one, name the console and I probably have owned it. So I never really had to jump through hoops and Wine to run Windows games. Bar perhaps Championship Manager, but even that I quit since I discovered its such a time sucker.
Despite that, the news of  porting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo">World of Goo</a> to Linux was refreshing. The more devs and hardware vendors who recognize Linux as a market the better. Eventually we will get to the tipping point and have mass recognition.
But to be honest, I never heard of the game before, the story was slashdotted which piqued my interest.
> World of Goo was designed by a small team of two ex-Electronic Arts developers, Kyle Gabler and Ron Carmel, who [used their entire combined savings][1] of $10,000.00 USD to create the gooey game aimed at guiding goo balls to salvation.
I was skeptical actually, didn't want to get overly excited only to get disappointed at the end. There was only one way to find out: <a href="http://worldofgoo.com/dl2.php?lk=demo">download the demo</a>.
All in all I was overly impressed, the game installed without a hitch and worked straight out of the box. Visually, the game was amazing and I loved the gooey eye popping graphics. It was a no-brainer for me, forking out $20 for this game was actually a privilege! Here watch it for yourself:</p>

World of Goo is DRM free, meaning you can install it on all your systems with no limits. Sadly this also makes it wide open for piracy. I really do hope that people will do the right thing and actually buy this game, after all we already have discussed how <a href="/blog/linuxobservations/do-commercial-software-companies-make-money-from-pirates/">piracy actually hurts Open Source</a>, and we don't really wanna do that now do we?
Gaming is Linux's Achielles heel, and it is one of the main reasons a lot of people are steering away from it. **"It won't play my games"** a lot would lament! But you know what? No developer really thinks of Linux as a viable market. Luckily World of Goo gave us Linux users a chance to dispel this myth once and for all. According to the<a href="http://2dboy.com/2009/02/12/world-of-goo-linux-version-is-ready/?linux=goo">developer's blog</a>:
> **** It's only been 2 days since the release of the Linux version and it already accounts for 4.6% of the full downloads from our website.  Our thanks to everyone who's playing the game on Linux and spreading the word.  Here are a couple of nifty stats:
> 
> * About 12% of Linux downloads are of the .rpm package, 30% are of the .tar.gz package, and 57% are of the .deb package.
> * More copies of the game were sold via our website on the day the Linux version released than any other day.  This day beat the previous record by 40%. There is a market for Linux games after all <img alt=":)" src="http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" />
So if you care about Linux, do the right thing and <a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php">buy the game</a>.
